# react-native-todo-list


A simple TODO list to try to implemented using RefluxJS (ReactNative ed )
The following TODO list I tried to implemented using RefluxJS.
(You do not have to exactly the same 
such as the hierarchical structure of the Component)


IN THE TERMINAL(make sure you have node...):


React requires Watchmen for the node server
 <code>brew install watchman</code>
 
 
 React requires flow for the node server
 <code>brew install flow</code>
 
 
 Install the react-native module
 <code>sudo npm install -g react-native-cli</code>
 
 
 react-native init creates a new react-native project
 <code>react-native init 'newProjectName' </code>
 
 
 get up init
 <code>cd 'newProjectName' </code>
 
 
 install RefluxJS
 <code>sudo npm install</code>
